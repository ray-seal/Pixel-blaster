## Installation

### Play in Browser
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Install as PWA (Mobile)
1. Open the game in your mobile browser
2. Use the browser's "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Launch from your home screen for a full-screen experience

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- Service Worker for PWA capabilities
- Web App Manifest for installation

## Development

No build tools required! This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript game that runs directly in the browser.

To modify the game:
1. Edit `game.js` for game logic
2. Edit `style.css` for visual styling
3. Edit `index.html` for structure

### Adding New Loot Types

The loot system is designed to be extensible. To add a new loot type:

1. Add a new entry to the `LOOT_TYPES` object in `game.js`:
```javascript
NEW_LOOT: {
    id: 'unique_id',
    name: 'Display Name',
    color: '#hexcolor',
    shape: 'circle', // or 'square'
    duration: 8000, // milliseconds
    type: 'beneficial', // or 'challenging'
    apply: () => {
        // Code to apply the effect
        player.someProperty = true;
    },
    remove: () => {
        // Code to remove the effect
        player.someProperty = false;
    }
}
```

2. Add any necessary player properties or game state variables
3. Implement the effect logic in the appropriate game functions
4. The loot will automatically appear in the random drop pool

### Loot System Architecture
